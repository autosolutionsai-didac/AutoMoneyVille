Persona class for Claudeville simulation.

This module defines the Persona class that powers the AI agents in the simulation.
Each persona has memory structures (spatial, associative, scratch) and uses a
unified prompting system for decision-making.

Claudeville uses one LLM call per step via UnifiedPersonaClient, replacing the
original multi-step cognitive chain.

        persona perceives the closest att_bandwidth number of events in case there
        are too many events.

        Second, the persona does not want to perceive and think about the same
        event at each time step. That's where <retention> comes in -- there is
        temporal order to what the persona remembers. So if the persona's memory
